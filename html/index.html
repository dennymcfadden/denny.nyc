    <h1>Hi, I'm Denny.</h1>
    <p>I’m a digital product designer who has been helping mission-driven companies to scale for more than a decade. I'm currently consulting with companies of all sizes and I would love to work with you on your next project.</p>
    <p>Most recently I helped <a href="https://www.architizer.com/" target="_blank">Architizer</a> scale the world's first online marketplace for architectural materials from a private beta to a professional workflow tool that's now used by 7 of the 10 largest architecture firms in the US.</p>
    <p>As the founding product designer at <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/" target="_blank">Hillary for America</a> I assembled a diverse team that designed 42 applications in 16 months, raised $960 million dollars, and earned the votes of 66 million Americans.</p>
    <p>Prior to the campaign I was the first product designer at <a href="http://www.charitywater.org" target="_blank">charity: water</a>, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/business/media/marketing-charity-water-syria.html" target="_blank">innovative</a> fundraising organization that inspired Tony Hawk, Will Smith, Richard Branson, and thousands of <a href="https://vimeo.com/46300983" target="_blank">everyday people</a> to fundraise for those in need. During my time there, we successfully implemented sustainable water solutions for more than 5 million people in 22 countries.
    <p>I've also worked with <a href="http://www.generalassemb.ly" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>, <a href="http://hardcandyshell.com/" target="_blank">Hard Candy Shell</a>, <a href="http://disney.com/" target="_blank">Disney</a>, <a href="http://discovery.com/" target="_blank">Discovery Channel</a>, and  <a href="http://aol.com/" target="_blank">AOL</a>.</p>
    <p>I've spoken at the M.I.T. Global Innovation Summit and the Future of Web Design Conference, as well as various companies including <a href="http://dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> & <a href="http://ustwo.com/" target="_blank">ustwo</a>. And then there was that time I got to <a href="#img1">ring the bell</a><a href="#_" class="lightbox" id="img1" class="background-image:none;"><img src="images/denny_mcfadden_nyse.jpg"></a> at the New York Stock Exchange - that was cool.</p>
    <p>If you're working on something interesting, <a href="mailto:hi@denny.nyc" target="_blank">say hi</a>!</p>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by,</br>Denny</p>
